<h1>Foundations for Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; Views and Actions on the Environment, Stewardship, and Sustainability</h1> <h2> Introduction </h2> <p> In brief, the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; Faith began in Iran in 1844, with the teachings of a man whom we call The B&aacute;b. He was a prophet, or as Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s prefer, a Manifestation of the Cause of God. He established a new religion, separating from Islam. And yet, his primary mission was to prepare the way for another Manifestation whose laws and teachings would supersede His own. This second Manifestation is Bah&aacute;'u&rsquo;ll&aacute;h, who declared His revelation in 1863. Bah&aacute;'u&rsquo;ll&aacute;h taught that there is only one God, one eternal religion of God with many expressions through time, and that all of humanity is of "one race." He also taught that we have a dual purpose in life: while we must develop our individual spiritual qualities, we must also work to develop a new civilization. That is, personal and social "salvation" must go hand-in-hand. </p> <p> After Bah&aacute;'u&rsquo;ll&aacute;h's death in 1892, His Son &lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute; led the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; community, whose members were at that time to be found in Iran, throughout the Ottoman Empire, and in India and Burma. &lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute; is considered the perfect example for the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s, and we treat His explanations of the religion with equal weight as those from His Father, although He Himself is not a Manifestation or Prophet. Following His own death in 1921, the reins of authority passed to &lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute;'s grandson Shoghi Effendi. Finally, in 1963, the nine-member Universal House of Justice was elected &ndash; an institution first mentioned by Bah&aacute;'u&rsquo;ll&aacute;h and whose purpose and purview were more fully developed by &lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute; and Shoghi Effendi. The Universal House of Justice is the central authority of the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; Faith, whose millions of adherents are spread across the globe, united in worship and practice. </p> <p> This is only the most cursory of introductions to the founders, authority-figures, and timeline of the religion, serving to provide some context for a discussion on environmentalism, stewardship, and sustainability. The pre-industrial Middle and Near East of the 19th century had far lower population densities than today, lagged far behind Europe in technology, and were in the midst of a great stagnation in the religious culture. In this context, the founders of the religion did not directly address modern environmental concerns, but they did lay out many principles that guide their followers. These can be seen as foundational ethics, mores, and worldviews. Elaborating on these principles, the guidance from Shoghi Effendi, and from the Universal House of Justice and institutions under their aegis, has provided a framework for expressing those principles in the real world. </p> <h2> Four Principles for Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; Environmentalism </h2> <p> There are many passages and principles in the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; writings that have bearing on Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; attitudes and approaches to our treatment and use of the natural environment. However, let us focus on just four of these for now, each of which will be exemplified by a quotation from Bah&aacute;'u&rsquo;ll&aacute;h or &lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute;: </p> <ol> <li>Nature as revelation</li> <li>Interdependence of all of creation</li> <li>Harmony of science and religion</li> <li>Dangers of materialism</li> </ol> <p> Just as with all of the other religions, there are many Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s who are concerned about environmental stewardship without the need for detailed theological justification. Nevertheless, these principles together serve as further motivation and can help guide a way of life wherein faith and social responsibility are integrated rather than compartmentalized. </p> <h3> Nature as Revelation </h3> <p> The word "revelation" refers to "God's disclosure of Himself and His will to His creatures," according to Random House Dictionary [a]. The monotheistic traditions in particular are based on the idea of a central human figure &ndash; the Manifestation of God, in Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; parlance &ndash; who performs this act of disclosure for the rest of humanity. Bah&aacute;'u&rsquo;ll&aacute;h declares that nature in itself is a source of revelation: </p> <blockquote> <p> Every thing must needs have an origin and every building a builder. Verily, the Word of God is the Cause which hath preceded the contingent worldï¿½a world which is adorned with the splendours of the Ancient of Days, yet is being renewed and regenerated at all times. Immeasurably exalted is the God of Wisdom Who hath raised this sublime structure. </p> <p> Look at the world and ponder a while upon it. It unveileth the book of its own self before thine eyes and revealeth that which the Pen of thy Lord, the Fashioner, the All-Informed, hath inscribed therein. It will acquaint thee with that which is within it and upon it and will give thee such clear explanations as to make thee independent of every eloquent expounder. </p> <p> Say: Nature in its essence is the embodiment of My Name, the Maker, the Creator. Its manifestations are diversified by varying causes, and in this diversity there are signs for men of discernment. Nature is God&rsquo;s Will and is its expression in and through the contingent world. It is a dispensation of Providence ordained by the Ordainer, the All-Wise. [b] </p> </blockquote> <p> If we believe that it is our duty to adhere to the Will of God, then it follows that we must study and learn to deeply appreciate nature, its laws and its diverse expressions. Does it not follow that humanity should restrain itself from interfering with the balance of forces in nature? </p> <p> Nature is not static: it changes and evolves through random chance and feedback mechanisms (e.g. a slight change in one creature promotes a change in the habitat, another creature adapts and causes a further change, and the first one adapts some more, and so on &ndash; that is &ldquo;feedback&rdquo;). This change is typically gradual and the product of non-moral forces. And yet our way of life is throwing ecosystems out of balance and causing the extirpation of thousands of species per year. [c] </p> <h3> Interdependence of All Creation </h3> <p> Both Bah&aacute;&rsquo;u&rsquo;ll&aacute;h and &lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute; speaks about the interdependence of creation. In several passages, Bah&aacute;&rsquo;u&rsquo;ll&aacute;h gives us an analogy of the &ldquo;world as a man&rsquo;s body,&rdquo; wherein the parts must be harmonized [d1]. Elsewhere, &lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute; extends this sense of connection to all of creation: </p> <blockquote> <p> Were one to observe with an eye that discovereth the realities of all things, it would become clear that the greatest relationship that bindeth the world of being together lieth in the range of created things themselves, and that cooperation, mutual aid and reciprocity are essential characteristics in the unified body of the world of being, inasmuch as all created things are closely related together and each is influenced by the other or deriveth benefit therefrom, either directly or indirectly&hellip;. Hence it was stated that co-operation and reciprocity are essential properties which are inherent in the unified system of the world of existence, and without which the entire creation would be reduced to nothingness. [d] </p> </blockquote> <p> This passage does not merely describe the world, but it also gives us an implicit prescription for how we should operate within it: we must work in "co-operation and reciprocity" with each other, and indeed with the rest of creation. </p> <h3> Harmony of Science and Religion </h3> <p> Both of these quotations do more than just hint at the need to study the natural order through reason. &lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute; takes this further by proclaiming that science and religion, which are sometimes presented as antagonistic to each other, must work together if each is to attain its highest purpose. In an address given while visiting the United States in 1912, &lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute; told his audience, </p> <blockquote> <p> Bah&aacute;'u&rsquo;ll&aacute;h has declared that religion must be in accord with science and reason. If it does not correspond with scientific principles and the processes of reason, it is superstition. For God has endowed us with faculties by which we may comprehend the realities of things, contemplate reality itself. If religion is opposed to reason and science, faith is impossible; and when faith and confidence in the divine religion are not manifest in the heart, there can be no spiritual attainment. [e] </p> </blockquote> <p> Today, the mainstream of science is warning us &ndash; ever more urgently &ndash; that our way of life is swiftly overtaking the boundaries of what the planet can sustain while maintaining its present degree of relative stability: we extract too much "raw material", causing massive damage to ecosystems, and then we turn it into new material whose byproducts cause further disruption to natural systems. Climate change due to carbon dioxide pollution and other factors threatens to further accelerate the extinction of species and varieties of life. And this will affect, indeed already is affecting, human societies, whose very existence is predicated on the current stability (temperature, rainfall, sea level) and on many of the threatened species (particularly "keystone" species such as elephants which play a significant role in maintaining an environment that is hospitable to myriad other forms of life). </p> <h3> Dangers of Materialism </h3> <p> Quite presciently, Bah&aacute;'u&rsquo;ll&aacute;h and &lsquo;Abdu&rsquo;l-Bah&aacute; provided a diagnosis for our environmental ills before the symptoms had even manifested: immoderation and materialism. The consumer culture, devoid of this interdependent spiritual outlook, uses up materials as if they were inexhaustible and as if they had no value in and of themselves. But if all of life contains the signs of God, then does not all of life then contain intrinsic value, regardless of its apparent worth to humanity? Lacking this essentially spiritual outlook, we go to excess. Bah&aacute;'u&rsquo;ll&aacute;h warns us: </p> <blockquote> <p> Whoso cleaveth to justice, can, under no circumstances, transgress the limits of moderation. He discerneth the truth in all things, through the guidance of Him Who is the All-Seeing. The civilization, so often vaunted by the learned exponents of arts and sciences, will, if allowed to overleap the bounds of moderation, bring great evil upon men. Thus warneth you He Who is the All-Knowing. If carried to excess, civilization will prove as prolific a source of evil as it had been of goodness when kept within the restraints of moderation. Meditate on this, O people, and be not of them that wander distraught in the wilderness of error. The day is approaching when its flame will devour the cities, when the Tongue of Grandeur will proclaim: &ldquo;The Kingdom is God&rsquo;s, the Almighty, the All-Praised!&rdquo; [f] </p> </blockquote> <p> Shoghi Effendi further makes it entirely clear that this is a reference to Western-style materialism, and an actual prophecy of disaster that will (and already has) come of it: </p> <blockquote> <p> It is this same cancerous materialism, born originally in Europe, carried to excess in the North American continent, contaminating the Asiatic peoples and nations, spreading its ominous tentacles to the borders of Africa, and now invading its very heart, which Bah&aacute;&rsquo;u&rsquo;ll&aacute;h in unequivocal and emphatic language denounced in His Writings, comparing it to a devouring flame and regarding it as the chief factor in precipitating the dire ordeals and world-shaking crises that must necessarily involve the burning of cities and the spread of terror and consternation in the hearts of men. Indeed a foretaste of the devastation which this consuming fire will wreak upon the world, and with which it will lay waste the cities of the nations participating in this tragic world-engulfing contest, has been afforded by the last World War, marking the second stage in the global havoc which humanity, forgetful of its God and heedless of the clear warnings uttered by His appointed Messenger for this day, must, alas, inevitably experience. [g] </p> </blockquote> <h2> A Framework for Action </h2> <p> These four principles, then, provide a framework for studying and valuing the natural environment, and for living moderately in a way that is to the benefit of all creatures. However, it is one thing to talk about a good and balanced way of life, but how we do put that into practice? How do we change our current habits &ndash; our actions &ndash; to become better aligned with the spiritual principles? </p> <h3> Community Building </h3> <p> Today, under the guidance of the Universal House of Justice, the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s all over the world are engaged in a process of community building. This process helps us unfold that two-fold purpose in life : developing our own spiritual qualities while working to create a better world for all. There are several related aspects to this process of community building, which is a process of building our capacity to change the world. </p> <p> At the local level, the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s emphasize four particular activities, open to people of any or no faith, that help us develop spiritual virtues, build bonds of love and unity, and learn how to be empowered to take action. Three of these encompass an educational process that addresses the needs of different age groups: virtues classes for children, a junior youth spiritual empowerment program, and study circles for youth and adults. These contribute to and are augmented by community devotional gatherings. Clusters of Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; communities work together to provide mutual support and facilitate a learning environment, where each can share its experiences, analyze their impacts, and adjust their courses of action. </p> <p> Themes of environmental awareness and sustainable living are beginning to show up in these settings. For example, several of the books in the junior youth curriculum include lessons that address respect and care for nature. These four activities are designed to encourage service to the community at large, and that service might take place through trash pickups, community recycling events, and the like. Furthermore, the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute; institutions themselves have encouraged further study and action on the environment, in the context of these four core activities. For example, the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s of the United States has encouraged communities to participate in the program of Interfaith Power and Light, including the National Preach-in on Global Warming each February. </p> <h3> Social Discourse and Engagement </h3> <p> The Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s are also encouraged to engage in social discourse at all levels. Thus in additional these grassroots community development efforts, Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s promote these ideas around spiritual civilization in interfaith groups, academia, social media, and any other venue open to them. At the international level, Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s have long participated in environmental conferences such as the 1992 Rio Summit and in the development of the Earth Charter. Many local, national, and international environmental organizations have strong participation from the Bah&aacute;&rsquo;&iacute;s, including various state boards of Interfaith Power and Light, and in leadership roles in the UN Environment Programme. </p> <p> Within this context, the Universal House of Justice has promoted a social science of evaluating the dynamics of and between three participants: the individual, the community, and institutions. These present three different lens for that social discourse, and for promoting action. For example, with respect to the environment, we should be asking ourselves: </p> <ol> <li> What can I do on the individual level, to bring my lifestyle in line with a balance that benefits every creature?</li> <li>What changes need to take place on the community level?</li> <li>And which changes require institutional action?</li> </ol> <p> In that light, one cannot merely wait for the government to change the laws in a manner that supports a healthy environment. We must each take actions to reduce and improve our material consumption (a significant theme in the junior youth curriculum and in that of the training for young adult "animators" of junior youth). But we know that individual actions alone with never solve our problems. What happens when we gather as a community? Do we use throw-away material? Do we look for opportunities to carpool, and to choose meeting locations that minimize the need to drive? What about our businesses &ndash; what are they doing to reduce waste? And in the end, some matters simply require governmental action: for example, the successful phasing out of ozone-depleting CFC's under the Montreal Protocol. </p> <footer> <p> [a] Random House 2013, via http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/revelation </p> <p> [b] Tablet of Wisdom, Tablets of Bah&aacute;&rsquo;u&rsquo;ll&aacute;h Revealed After the Kit&aacute;b-i-Aqdas.

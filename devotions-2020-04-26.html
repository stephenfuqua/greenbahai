                    I know not, O my God, what the Fire is which Thou didst kindle in Thy land. Earth can never cloud
                    its
                    splendor, nor water quench its flame. All the peoples of the world are powerless to resist its
                    force.
                    Great is the blessedness of him that hath drawn nigh unto it, and heard its roaring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some, O my God, Thou didst, through Thy strengthening grace, enable to approach it, while others
                    Thou
                    didst keep back by reason of what their hands have wrought in Thy days. Whoso hath hasted towards it
                    and
                    attained unto it hath, in his eagerness to gaze on Thy beauty, yielded his life in Thy path, and
                    ascended unto Thee, wholly detached from aught else except Thyself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I beseech Thee, O my Lord, by this Fire which blazeth and rageth in the world of creation, to rend
                    asunder the veils that have hindered me from appearing before the throne of Thy majesty, and from
                    standing at the door of Thy gate. Do Thou ordain for me, O my Lord, every good thing Thou didst send
                    down in Thy Book, and suffer me not to be far removed from the shelter of Thy mercy.
                </p>

                    Powerful art Thou to do what pleaseth Thee. Thou art, verily, the All-Powerful, the Most Generous.

                    The best beloved of all things in My sight is Justice; turn not away therefrom if thou desirest Me, and neglect it not that I may confide in thee. By its aid thou shalt see with thine own eyes and not through the eyes of others, and shalt know of thine own knowledge and not through the knowledge of thy neighbor. Ponder this in thy heart; how it behooveth thee to be. Verily justice is My gift to thee and the sign of My loving-kindness. Set it then before thine eyes.

                    Look at the world and ponder a while upon it. It unveileth the book of its own self before thine eyes and revealeth that which the Pen of thy Lord, the Fashioner, the All-Informed, hath inscribed therein. It will acquaint thee with that which is within it and upon it and will give thee such clear explanations as to make thee independent of every eloquent expounder.

                <p>
                    Say: Nature in its essence is the embodiment of My Name, the Maker, the Creator. Its manifestations are diversified by varying causes, and in this diversity there are signs for men of discernment. Nature is God’s Will and is its expression in and through the contingent world. It is a dispensation of Providence ordained by the Ordainer, the All-Wise. Were anyone to affirm that it is the Will of God as manifested in the world of being, no one should question this assertion. It is endowed with a power whose reality men of learning fail to grasp. Indeed a man of insight can perceive naught therein save the effulgent splendor of Our Name, the Creator. Say: This is an existence which knoweth no decay, and Nature itself is lost in bewilderment before its revelations, its compelling evidences and its effulgent glory which have encompassed the universe.

                    Unto Thee be praise, O Lord my God!  I entreat Thee, by Thy signs that have encompassed the entire creation, and by the light of Thy countenance that hath illuminated all that are in heaven and on earth, and by Thy mercy that hath surpassed all created things, and by Thy grace that hath suffused the whole universe, to rend asunder the veils that shut me out from Thee, that I may hasten unto the Fountain-Head of Thy mighty inspiration, and to the Day-Spring of Thy Revelation and bountiful favors, and may be immersed beneath the ocean of Thy nearness and pleasure.

                    Suffer me not, O my Lord, to be deprived of the knowledge of Thee in Thy days, and divest me not of the robe of Thy guidance.  Give me to drink of the river that is life indeed, whose waters have streamed forth from the Paradise (Ridván) in which the throne of Thy Name, the All-Merciful, was established, that mine eyes may be opened, and my face be illumined, and my heart be assured, and my soul be enlightened, and my steps be made firm.

                    Thou art He Who from everlasting was, through the potency of His might, supreme over all things, and, through the operation of His will, was able to ordain all things.  Nothing whatsoever, whether in Thy heaven or on Thy earth, can frustrate Thy purpose.  Have mercy, then, upon me, O my Lord, through Thy gracious providence and generosity, and incline mine ear to the sweet melodies of the birds that warble their praise of Thee, amidst the branches of the tree of Thy oneness.

                    A story from the life of Baha'u'llah, reflecting His love of growing things:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                <p>
                    &ldquo;&hellip; &grave;Abdu&#39;l-Bah&aacute; had&hellip; rented the Garden of Na&#39;mayn, an island situated in close proximity to the city of &grave;Akk&aacute;. He did this in anticipation of Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h&#39;s release from confinement. After His release Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h often visited this beautiful spot, usually in the spring, the summer and early autumn seasons. It was designated by Him as the Ridv&aacute;n Garden (Paradise); in some of His Tablets Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h refers to the garden as the 'New Jerusalem' and 'Our Verdant Isle'.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This garden was made beautiful through the dedication and hard work of the Persian believers and the constant supervision and guidance of the Master. They brought great quantities of soil from neighboring places to make flower-beds all around, while from Persian and neighboring countries the friends brought many shrubs, trees and flowering plants, some of them rare species. Crossing mountains and deserts, which took several months, they took such care that the plants arrived fresh and ready to be planted in the garden. The care with which the believers brought these plants by long hazardous journeys is an indication of a devotion and a love which finds no parallel in the annals of any religion and which is clearly demonstrated in the beauty of the garden itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The motive for undertaking this unusual task, which at first seemed impossible, was a deep sense of love for Bahá'u'lláh, a love which knew no bounds. The friends desired to offer Him an earthly gift of beauty which they knew He enjoyed so much. They went so far as to bring to `Akká the plant of a rare white rose which had been one of His favorite flowers in T&iacute;hr&aacute;n. In some of His Tablets Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h refers to these plants and expresses warm appreciation of the devotion of those who brought them."

                    O SON OF MAN!<br>
                    If thou lovest Me, turn away from thyself; and if thou seekest My pleasure, regard not thine own; that thou mayest die in Me and I may eternally live in thee.
                </p>

                    O FRIEND!<br>
                    In the garden of thy heart plant naught but the rose of love, and from the nightingale of affection and desire loosen not thy hold. Treasure the companionship of the righteous and eschew all fellowship with the ungodly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    O SON OF JUSTICE!<br>
                    Whither can a lover go but to the land of his beloved? and what seeker findeth rest away from his heart's desire? To the true lover reunion is life, and separation is death. His breast is void of patience and his heart hath no peace. A myriad lives he would forsake to hasten to the abode of his beloved.

This is my highest aspiration, mine ardent desire, O Thou Who rulest all things, and in Whose hand is the kingdom of the entire creation.  Thou, verily, doest what Thou choosest.  No God is there beside Thee, the Almighty, the All-Glorious, the Ever-Forgiving.

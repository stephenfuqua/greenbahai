                    In resolving to act on climate change and pollution more generally, we must consult, one with
                    another, seeking out experts and the inviting the equal participation of people from all walks of
                    life. What will it look like to heed the call to compassion as we take counsel together?

            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-8">
                <p> We we are learning how to avoid or overcome dichotomous thinking: the tendency to pit two
                    ideas against each other, with a consequent refusal to accept that both may contain elements
                    of the truth.</p>
                <p>
                    Within the environmental movement we can find two major strains of thought about the scope of action
                    required to halt the drivers of climate change: some organizations and activists, on the one hand,
                    emphasize the primacy of individual actions, while others dismiss the value of individual action
                    in relation to the overwhelming impact of industrial activity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scenario: there's a call to reduce driving, thereby reducing oil consumption. 1% heed the call.
                    Drop removed from the bucket; no one notices. Alternately, call on fossil fuel companies to
                    stop drilling; 1% response would be far more impactful, because of the myriad ways oil is used.
                    Which is more important?
                </p>
                <p>
                    We need much more than 1% response in both categories. Those who produce the resources will
                    only respond to two pressures: regulation, which is not forthcoming or acting quickly enough,
                    or reduced demand (which could be driven by carbon taxation). Individuals need to step up to
                    help reduce demand for fossil fuels used
                    in the transportation, household, commercial, and manufacturing sectors. Businesses need
                    to heed the call to shift their investments to sustainable uses, while governments continue
                    to ratchet up the regulatory restrictions at the behest of the individuals they serve.

                    The top two solutions address the question of how we generate the energy we use, so that we shift
                    from burning fossil fuels (and from generating nuclear waste) to using the power of the sun via wind
                    power and solar radiation.

                <p>
                    In the City of Austin, where I live, those who can affor to do so can choose to subsidize wind or
                    solar
                    power, at an estimated additional cost of $7.50 or $14.00 per month, respectively. In addition to
                    our
                    individual consumption, we can ask our places of business to change their electricity supply,
                    and we can support city-wide efforts. Austin's citywide goal is to source 65% of its electricity
                    from
                    renewable sources by 2027; as of early 2020, it has already passed the 50% threshold. Many other

                    The agriculatural sector, while attempting to feed the world, is also a major contributor to
                    greenhouse gas emissions. Again we can see the urgent need for individual action: taking more
                    care with the food we purchase and choosing to reduce the consumption of animal products (especially
                    damaging:
                    cow, sheep, and camel meat and milk products). These are changes that begin with the individual,
                    and continue through to the community (restaurants, institutional foodservice, etc.).

                    It is interesting and gratifying to see that
                    Project Drawdown does not advocate a strict abandonment of meat consumption &mdash; an approach
                    that arguably turns more people away than it attracts. Furthermore, there are strong ecological
                    arguments
                    for continued grazing of cattle on grasslands (not feedlots). In any case, it is clear that we
                    <em>do</em> consume
                    more animal products than the world can sustain, and the diets of rich and poor alike need to shift
                    quickly toward sustainable agriculture.

                <p>
                    Although &ldquo;health and education&rdquo; is the general theme, Project Drawdown is very clear
                    that the pressing need is for improved education of girls and provision of family planning services.
                    The education of girls is a particular strength of Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; communities, where
                    education of children is compulsory and favors the education of the girl-child if a choice must be
                    made.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These two measures effectively reduce continued population growth and the consequent unsustainable
                    growth in consumption. Improved education is also essential to adaptation and more equitable
                    distribution of resources.

                <p class="h4">
                    &rdquo;Thou hast written that they have pledged themselves to observe maximum austerity in their
                    lives with a view to forwarding the remainder of their income to His exalted presence. This
                    matter was mentioned at His holy court. He said: Let them act with moderation and not impose
                    hardship upon themselves. We would like them both to enjoy a life that is well-pleasing.&ldquo;
                </p>

                        data-content="Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h, quoted in the compilation <a href='www.bahai.org/r/825655618' target='_blank'>Ḥuq&uacute;qu&#39;ll&aacute;h&mdash;The Right of God</a>">Bah&aacute;&#39;u&#39;ll&aacute;h</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Is this a recipe for austerity? The call for moderation in the Bah&aacute;&#39;&iacute; Faith is not
                    a call for ascetism. Likewise, the call to lower our use of electricity, to shift to a more
                    plant-rich
                    diet, to spend more of our precious wealth on education of girls, to drive less, and ultimately
                    to spend more time in prayer, reflection, study, and action is not a call for a life
                    less-well-lived.
                    Rather is it a call to live our best lives, in harmony and concern for the well-being of all
                    instead of the well-being of only one or a few.
